2. Have all your materials, shaders and models in the maps addon folder ([Guide](https://github.com/DeltaDesigns/Charm/blob/main/README.md#source-2-only-supports-sbox-at-the-moment))
 
## How to install

1. Add this tool to s&box through the projects manager
2. In Hammer, make a new map
3. Click "Importer" in the top tool bar
4. Navigate to where the maps "info.cfg" file is located and select it
5. Wait, this may take some time!
